        <h1><strong>What is the background of this mod?</strong></h1>
        <p>
            The full name of TNO is <strong>The New Order: Last Days of Europe</strong>. This is an overhead historical MOD with the Axis powers winning World War II as the background. The game started in 1962. The plot of the game mainly revolved around the <strong>three-way Cold War</strong> between America, Germany and Japan. As the content of the TNO worldview introduction is too long, it has been written at the bottom. Those who are interested can check it first.

        <h1><strong>Does the production team have neo-Nazi or fascist tendencies?</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDo not. On the contrary, the basic position of the production team is <strong>anti-fascist</strong>. Whether it is Germany, Japan, Italy, Iberia and other fascist countries, they have encountered problems that are so serious that they shake the foundation of their rule in the two decades after the victory of the war . The <strong>German</strong> economy collapsed in the 1950s, and the Axis powers were also dissolved at that time. The German government managed to maintain the economic situation through slavery. Although Hitler was still alive at the start, he will die soon, and once the founder of the empire dies, the German mainland will be plunged into a bloody four-way war. <strong>Japan</strong> also practices a certain degree of slavery, and it implements a closed economy that only trades with puppet countries in the co-prosperity circle, but the yen has already lost its credibility. There is a serious antagonism between the Japanese navy and the army, and both sides have nuclear weapons. <strong>Italy</strong>’s economy collapsed because of the Gibraltar Dam built by Germany, and the declining coastline destroyed the coastal cities on the Apennines, and the anti-German alliance it established with Iberia and Turkey was also because of the three member states. Internal contradictions and precarious...</p>

        <h1><strong>Why is Russia broken?</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough the four major regions of Russia (Western Russia, Western Siberia, Central Siberia, and the Far East) are in a state of warlord separatism, the reasons are different.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWestern Russia: After the defeat of the war, the Western-Russian Revolutionary Front was forced to retreat. On the way, local governments or warlords repeatedly announced their separation from the front. In the end, only the territory of Arkhangelsk was left on the front, and the rest were separated from the front by warlords. State occupied. In addition, some warlords were formed by collaborators who worked for the Germans during the Western-Russian War (such as Samara and Vyatka).
            West Siberia: This place was once ruled by the People’s Republic of West Siberia, which was founded during the collapse of the Soviet Union. After the Western-Russian War, two important generals-Konstantin Rokosovsky and Dmitry Karbyshev- Disagreements with leader Lazar Kaganovich, led his own military factions to stand on their own, forming two warlords of Sverdlovsk and Omsk; Zlatoust warlord was formerly Western Russia A state of merchants established by the revolutionary front general Mikhail Kalashnikov and the mayor of Zlatoust Yevgeny Dragunov; the warlord of Ugra was founded by the Volkuta concentration camp (It is also a warlord in the region) A country of thieves established by one faction of the insurgents (the other faction went south to the Southern Urals and formed the Ural Alliance).</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCentral Siberia: Similar to Western Siberia, it was once controlled by the "Republic of Scholars" Central Siberia. However, the successive wars with the Supreme Presidium of the Far East (the "Siberian War") caused many war-weary officers in the Republic's army to launch mutinies and occupy most of the important territory of the Republic. The uprising of the Siberian Black Army was another important reason for the split of the Republic</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFar East: This was once the territory of the Supreme Presidium of the Far East. In the 1950s, the Supreme Presidium was attacked by the Central Siberian Republic and the White Army's coalition forces, and transferred all the way to the Irkutsk region. Subsequently, the brutal rule of the regime leader Henrich Yagoda led to an uprising in Aldan and Buryat. On the other hand, the white coalition forces that had attacked the Supreme Presidium regime with the support of Japan also split into three warlords.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn addition, Germany, unwilling to lose most of the Russian territory, sent its air force to carry out extensive bombing of Russia. Although the Luftwaffe's bombing was limited to the two regions of West Russia and West Siberia under the blockade of the free pilot warlord (located in the West Siberia region), this has also become a reason why the two regions have been unable to unify.</p>
        <h1><strong>Why has the Mediterranean become smaller?</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the 1950s after the victory, in order to show off its national strength, Germany decided to implement the Atlantropa plan, part of which was to build a dam in Gibraltar to fill the Mediterranean, because they believed that they could create a lot of land out of thin air to feed. More population. Unfortunately, Germany’s economy collapsed halfway through the plan, and the dam did not create 10,000 acres of fertile land as they expected. The declining coastline instead dealt a catastrophic blow to the countries along the Mediterranean. The port city has never been smashed, which is why countries such as Iberia and Italy have turned against Germany.</p>
        <h1><strong>Why is there a big lake in Africa?</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGermany has done similar things in the Congo River Basin. As part of the Atlanta Project, they need to create a waterway in the interior of Africa. Therefore, they built a dam in the lower reaches of the Congo River, and the water from the Congo River was hoarded in the Congo Basin to form a large lake. As for the feelings of the locals... Obviously German bureaucrats would not consider this.</p>
        <h1><strong>What is that big black Anarchy in Africa?</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGermany is also carrying out similar bombing operations in this area as in Russia. Therefore, this place has fallen into a state of complete anarchy due to the two reasons of bombing and warlord melee, and no one can establish a normal regime here. However, after Germany stops bombing, countries will gradually appear here, and countries along the coast of West Africa will gradually expand inland.</p>
        <h1><strong>What did Himmler think? What is going on in Burgundy?</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter seeing the collapse of the German economy, the resurgence of Russian resistance and the suspension of various ethnic cleansing policies in the 1950s, Himmler became convinced that the Nazi Party itself had fallen and that traditional Nazism could no longer lead the Aryans to victory, so he created Out of the Burgundy system. This ideology is mixed with a lot of extreme personality worship and pagan worship of Himmler himself, and basically only fanatical SS members will accept this idea. In short, Himmler is crazy.
            <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs for Burgundy, it is the product of other forces in Germany planning to weaken Himmler's power. Himmler was originally the most powerful person in Germany except Hitler, and the other four contenders for the head of state simply could not compete with the mighty Himmler SS. As a result, the domestic anti-Himmler forces united and carried out a series of attacks and plantings against his SS, and finally forced Himmler to accept the Burgundy plan. That is to say, a piece of land was set aside in the territories of Belgium and France to be controlled by Himmler at the cost of having to withdraw from the political struggle in Germany.
